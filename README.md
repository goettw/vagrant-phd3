# vagrant-phd3

Vagrant based Pivotal HD cluster setup. The vagrant file and helper scripts sets up a 3 node cluster and an ambari host with all the required steps as mentioned in the Pivotal HD installation guide.


There are some pre-requise files that must be downloaded to the root vagrant directory.  

Details to follow.

The project is inspired by an existing Vagrant project created by Christian Tzolov from Pivotal.
